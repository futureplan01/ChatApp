# ChatApp

Chat application that is a client server model.

Allow users to communicate cross Java platform.

Still need to work on a couple of changes

1) Handle the disconnection of the socket
2) Allow users to connect to other computers instead of jsut connecting with itself
3) Handle the text errors with the GUi to allow transaction to be easier
